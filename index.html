      *From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia* <br />
      <br />
      In Greco-Roman geography, Colchis (Ancient Greek: Κολχίς) was an exonym
      for the Georgian polity of Egrisi (Georgian: ეგრისი) located on the coast
      of the Black Sea, centered in present-day western Georgia. It has been
      described in modern scholarship as "the earliest Georgian formation",
      which, along with the Kingdom of Iberia, would later contribute
      significantly to the development of the Kingdom of Georgia and the
      Georgian nation. <br />
      Colchis is known in Greek mythology as the destination of the Argonauts,
      as well as the home to Medea and the Golden Fleece. <br />
      It was also described as a land rich with gold, iron, timber and honey
      that would export its resources mostly to ancient Hellenic city-states.
      Colchis is generally believed to have been populated by early
      Kartvelian-speaking tribes ancestral to the contemporary western
      Georgians, namely Svans and Zans. According to David Marshall Lang: "one
      of the most important elements in the modern Georgian nation, the
      Colchians were probably established in the Caucasus by the Middle Bronze
      Age." Colchis likely had a diverse population. <br />
      According to Greek and Roman sources, between 70 and 300 languages were
      spoken in Dioscourias (modern Sukhumi) alone. <br />
      Abkhaz, Scythian, Anatolian, and Greek names have all been identified in
      Colchis. <br />
      Any of these groups could have constituted the ruling class. Its geography
      is mostly assigned to what is now the western part of Georgia and
      encompasses the present-day Georgian provinces of Samegrelo, Imereti,
      Guria, Adjara, Abkhazia, Svaneti, Racha; modern Russia's Sochi and Tuapse
      districts; and present-day Turkey’s Artvin, Rize, and Trabzon provinces.
